* Generate a ground truth dataset for question & answer over 35 Wikipedia articles from the SQUaD dataset.
* Load the data to Astra DB for vector search
* Build a simple agentic chatbot that uses the SQUaD data
* Create and run experiments with different embedding models, LLMs, and prompts
* Use Arize to track experiments and understand how changes affect accuracy
